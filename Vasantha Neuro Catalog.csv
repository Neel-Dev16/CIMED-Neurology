Muscle strength testing is an important component of the physical exam that can reveal information about neurologic deficits. 
It is used to evaluate weakness and can be effective in differentiating true weakness from imbalance or poor endurance.

Similar stories, whether through crop dusters direct spraying on farmers, spray drift land on workers, or contact with pesticide residues, occur every year (~100 reported cases in IL each year, 3000 nationally)",prevention,A way to track and prevent pesticide exposure in farmworkers ,"Rural settings typically are under-resourced for medical care
Patient triage is even more important to determine which patients can be given a seat on the ambulance for higher-acuity care
Decontamination stations need to be set up rapidly, with sufficient PPE needed for emergency responders to aid chemically-exposed patients
Patient belongings must be tossed or kept away due to being contaminated
Busses, ambulances, hospital bed, etc must be decontaminated afterwards as well
Current Safety measures: Signs indicating unsafe fields
Crop dusters circle fields, checking for humans (wearing bright orange hats) prior to pesticide spray
Makeshift shower tents and decontamination stations for acute pesticide exposure events
Disposable coveralls to wear after contact with pesticides, as it is required to strip off and dispose of contaminated clothes
Self-reports of pesticide exposure to CDC, EPA, etc.","Farmers can mark fields they are actively working in with an easily transportable, ultra-light pole with a flag/banner attached
The flag will allow crop duster airplane pilots to more easily identify fields to avoid
Fluorescent orange color (same as safety vests) to enable visibility from afar by crop duster airplane pilots
Flag can also be an indicator of wind direction, in combination with wind speed, can help the pilot determine amount of pesticide spray drift
